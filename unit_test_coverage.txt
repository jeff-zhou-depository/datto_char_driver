Test Environment:
platform: 
Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-5005U CPU @ 2.00GHz
RAM: 2G
Operating System: Debian derivative
Linux kernel version: 4.4.0-21-generic
gcc version: 5.4.0 20160609

Test Coverage:
1. Function test, insmod, rmmod, open the device, read, ioctl.
Verify the device and the CLI output.

2. Concurrency test I
2.1 load the driver, run test_ioctl to set the char, run test_read to verify the result.
2.2 run test_ioctl to modify the char, the test_read output CLI continuously output the changed char by ioctl.

3 Concurrency test II
Similar with 2, but introduce multiple test_read instances, then change the char by test_ioctl,
all the test_read CLI windows update the output at the same time.
