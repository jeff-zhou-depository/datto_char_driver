This directory includes the source code of datto_char_driver and the unit test code.

Type "make" to build the driver.
In "test" directory, type "make" to build the unit test applications,
"test_read" and "test_ioctl" will be generated.

Multiple instances of the user-space test applications are allowed, due to the driver's concurrency handling.

Other documents:
"unit_test_example.txt" describes a basic functional test example.
"unit_test_coverage.txt" describes the test coverage includes concurrency test.
